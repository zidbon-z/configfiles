This a guide to configure your system for bspwm after a basic arch installation.

# First install some programs
sudo pacman -S xorg xorg-xinit bspwm sxhkd nitrogen kitty xterm alsa-utils udiskie thunar git dmenu ntfs-3g pulseaudio-alsa lxappearance qt5ct breeze-gtk deepin-gtk-theme picom unclutter ncdu firefox os-prober openssh nvidia-settings virtualbox newsboat vlc mpv youtube-dl calcurse w3m python-pillow irssi figlet bpytop 

# Next clone config files
cd ~/.config
git clone https://github.com/zidbon-z/configfiles

# Copy config files to their respective directories(eventually sym-link them from the configfiles directory) 

# Set up dual monitors
Run xrandr to find out what the monitors are called
Go to the bspwmrc file and make sure the monitors are labled correctly
Set up a 10-monitor.conf file in the /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/ directory (copy from backup)

# Update grub
(for uefi)
sudo grub-install --target=x86_64-efi --efi-directory=/boot/EFI --bootloader-id=GRUB
(for non-uefi)
sudo grub-install --target=i386-pc /dev/sdx
Then run:
sudo grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
After the first time running the above commands, the update commands are:
update-grub
sudo grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg

#Eliminate screen tearing
Add the picom config folder containing picom.conf to the ~/.config directory
Make sure that vsync is enabled
If that doesn't work try:
For Nvidia
Use nvidia-xconfig to generate xorg.conf
Add line:	 
	Option		"TearFree"	"true"
If the screen is still tearing research:
	Set up a 20-nvidia.conf file in the /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/ directory

For non-Nvidia
xrandr --output DP-1 --set TearFree on 
(DP-1 is a placeholder. Use the monitor name. Must be repeated for all monitors.)

# Set firefox to go fullscreen in window
In the firefox search bar type: about:config
Change the "full-screen-api.ignore-widgets" to true

# Stop screen from going to sleep
xset -dpms
xset s off

# SSH generation and adding key to github
openssh should be installed but if not:
sudo pacman -S openssh
From your home folder enter:
ssh-keygen
Copy the id_rsa.pub key to the ssh keys at github.com
In each folder on your machine that is connected to a git repo, enter:
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:[username]/[reponame]

# Install yay
sudo pacman -S --needed base-devel git
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/yay.git
cd yay
makepkg -si

# Spacevim
curl -sLf https://spacevim.org/install.sh | bash

# MuttWizard for email

# Newsboat for youtube and rss feeds

# Vimwiki
In your home directory enter the command:
  git clone git@github.com:zidbon-z/vimwiki

Make sure that you don't already have a vimwiki directory in your home directory.
